<h1>Proinsias Cassidy</h1>
<p>Proinsias Cassidy is a 119 year old Irish vampire who has been on the run from Vampire-hunting religious vigilantes. After arriving in Annville, Cassidy befriended the local preacher, Jesse Custer. Though Cassidy told Jesse of his vampirism, the latter initially assumed he was joking. Cassidy allowed himself to be burnt in the sun in front of Jesse, hoping he would get Jesse to learn to stop judging people for who they are.</p>
<p>After learning God abandoned Heaven, Cassidy joined Jesse and Tulip on a crusade to find God. Along the way, they stopped in New Orleans, where Cassidy learned his son, Denis is dying. After deliberation, Cassidy ultimately turned his son into a vampire. However, after his son was unable to control his new appetites, Cassidy was forced to leave Denis to burn in the sun.</p>
<p>Not much is known about Cassidy's early life. He was born in Dublin in the late 19th century. When he was thirty, he was transformed into a vampire. Dating from 1922 to 1961, Cassidy already had several arrests. Cassidy had committed assault and battery in Las Vegas. Cassidy claimed to have done so as he disliked magicians. Cassidy was arrested for drunk and disorderly manner in Denver, as well as lewd and lascivious behavior. In New York City, Cassidy attempted murder, where Cassidy claimed to have lost his head. In 1946, Cassidy fathered Denis, promising to be the best father he'll ever see.</p>

<h2>Powers</h2>
<p><b>Vampirism</b>: Cassidy is a vampire, which gives him multiple supernatural powers. Cassidy can use his bite to turn those who are dying into vampires, as demonstrated when he converted his dying son, Denis, into a vampire to heal him and make him immortal.</p>
<p><b>Immortality</b>: While not invincible, Cassidy is unbeholden to the passing of time as well as the infirmities of old age. He retains the appearance of when he was turned and his vampirism affords him both preternatural vitality and flawless bodily health and physical faculties at all times, regardless of his actual age. </p>
<p><b>Superhuman immunity</b>: Cassidy's vampiric body grants him protection from the negative effects of drug use while still allowing him to enjoy the positives. Cassidy enjoys recreational use of various drugs and is extremely fond of alcohol.</p>
<p><b>Blood empowerment</b>: As a vampire, Cassidy draws his strength from the blood of living creatures. He must consume blood regularly to sustain his strength, keep himself from weakening, and to satiate his cravings, which could turn him rabid and uncontrollable, similar to drug withdrawal.</p>
<p><b>Superhuman strength</b>: While not displaying the full extent of his strength, Cassidy's vampirism grants him noticeably superhuman strength sufficient to lift over 800 lbs, possibly up to 1 ton or more. He was therefore strong enough to drag a cow into a hole with only one hand while most of his body was destroyed by his jumping out of a plane. His strength, however, appears to fluctuate based on how recently he has consumed blood, as he has been shown struggle in overpowering humans, such as Jesse Custer and angels, such as DeBlanc and Fiore.</p>
<p><b>Regenerative durability</b>: Cassidy naturally possesses a seemingly inhuman resilience to pain and is able to completely heal and recover from any damage to his body by drinking blood, though it is not immediate and he can still be weakened by damage as humans are, but to a far lesser degree. After falling from 30,000 feet in the air and crashing into a crater on the ground, Cassidy's body was almost completely obliterated from the impact, having his entrails disgorged and his right arm cut off. When a passing cow came by, Cassidy fed upon it and his body regenerated completely within a very short period of time from the power the cow's blood granted him, likely in mere hours.</p>
<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
<p><b>Sun sensitivity</b>: Cassidy, as a vampire, is extremely sensitive to the sun. Upon exposing his hand to direct sunlight, it began to smolder, while taking off his shirt and walking into the sunlight caused him to become engulf in fire. However, Sunscreen, shadows, and his clothing, especially a hood, can protect him from the suns rays and keep him from burning.</p>
<p><b>Blood dependency</b>: Although Cassidy claims to prefer single malt to blood, he is still dependent on the substance to recover when injured and possibly to continue living at all.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p><b>Skilled fighter: As shown during the fight in the airplane, Cassidy is a "down and dirty" street brawler style fighter. Cassidy seems to have no formal training, but is presumably highly experienced given his long life.</p>

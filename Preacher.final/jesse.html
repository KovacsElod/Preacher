<h1>Jesse Custer</h1>
<p>Reverend Jesse Custer (born July 30, 1984) is a former Texas preacher who merged with a mysterious creature known as Genesis, developing the ability to make anyone do anything he says.

When Jesse summoned God in front of Annville, Jesse realized the figure was an impostor. After learning that God had abandoned Heaven, Jesse began a crusade with Tulip and Cassidy, in search of God. After learning God enjoys jazz, Jesse and his friends left for New Orleans. However, after learning the messiah is a "moron", Jesse reluctantly Herr Starr's offer on taking Humperdoo's place.
</p>
<p>Jesse often helped his father prepare the church for Sunday service.</p>
<p>When he was caught with his friends who were smoking, his father made an example of him by whipping him in front of them.</p>
<p>John Custer: "Much bigger things are comin' for you. Much bigger things than this here. So you got to be one of the good guys. 'Cause why?"
<br>Jesse Custer: "'Cause there's way too many of the bad."
â€”Jesse's promise to his father.</p>
<P>Jesse was woken up one night. Jesse was told to hide under the bed. Once he hid, he watched his father get knocked out. Jesse and his father were then dragged outside. Jesse then watched his father killed in front of him by a man with a tattoo of a skull and a star and horseshoe in a single tattoo on his right arm. Before his father was killed, he promised him to grow up to be one of the good guys, before apologizing to his dad, telling him he asked for him to be killed.</P>

<p>After his fathers execution, Jesse was taken to Angelville. Jesse was stuffed into a coffin, which was placed beneath the swamps of Angelville until he accepted himself as a L'Angelle.

As a teenager, Jesse served as a parking attendant for his grandmothers business. At one point, he killed a chicken out of anger but quickly took it to Madame L'Angelle to resurrect.</p>
<p>At one point, Jesse and Tulip did "jobs" together. Meanwhile, the two had a relationship. The two worked for a Mexican cartel in Miami transporting reptiles.

In 2010, Jesse and Tulip were on the run from the Rodriguez brothers. Once, the two ate at a diner outside Kansas City.</p>
<p>In 2014, during a bank robbery with Carlos, Jesse and Tulip were betrayed. While fooling and flirting on the job, Carlos was upset and jealous of the two. Carlos set a security guard free, who Jesse would ultimately kill. The shock of Carlos' betrayal caused Tulip to miscarry.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p><b>Divine commandment/Absolute mind control</b>: Jesse's merge with Genesis endows him with a power known only as the Word of God. A power both blasphemous and blessed, the Word of God allows Jesse to literally speak with God's direct personal authority; commanding anyone to do anything he says. Those affected by the Word must do everything and anything he says to the letter. For example, in the pilot, he told Ted Reyerson, who asked Jesse's advice concerning his mother, to "open your heart to her". Ted then payed a visit to his mother and after explaining his point of view, ripped out his heart and gave it to her (literally) then died. Alternatively, If Jessie's command is not specific it can can be open to interpretation by the person effected. For example, he commanded Odin Quincannon to "serve God" and as Odin didn't believe in any god except the "God of meat", "What's tangible", he began expanding his meat processing empire by any means necessary and continued denying his belief in any god. If Jesse gives a command that is not physically possible the person affected will do their best to fulfil it regardless of how impossible, as when he commanded Cassidy to "fly" and Cassidy jumped as high as he could and slammed into a wall . Jessie's power can also effect memories, as in See, a bus driver, Linus, told Jesse he was attracted to a young girl, and in an act of anger, Jesse told him to forget her, which lead to Linus completely forgetting the girl, including any conversations about her. The power of the Word of God is so potent even angels can't resist it, as DeBlanc quickly told the truth as soon as Jesse demanded it. Later when Deblanc and Fiore were following him, he told them both to stay away from him, and they immediately stopped in their tracks. The Word of God also grants Jesse authority over the souls of others and where they reside, as he commanded Eugene to "go to hell" and a moment later Eugene vanished, awakening in hell. The Saint of Killers also sought to use this aspect of Jesse's power to reach heaven. As long as his commands can be heard, people can be affected. Jessie can use loud speakers to command large crowds and was even able to command an angel in Heaven over the Heaven phone.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p><b>Theology</b>: As a preacher, Jesse Custer is an expert in the concept of religious beliefs, particularly Christianity.</p>
<p><b>Sermons</b>: As a preacher, Jesse Custer frequently delivers sermons. At times he can deliver with great confidence. This was demonstrated when he delivered a successful sermon in front of his first large crowd. That sermon gave him many compliments from the town. Jesse however, wasn't always a perfect preacher. While performing a sermon on the the Parable of the Five Foolish Bridesmaids, Jesse was flustered looking through his notes.</p>
<p><b>Expert fighter</b>: As shown numerous times, Jesse is an extremely powerful combatant, able to overpower multiple opponents at once. Being taught by Jody how to fight, Jesse is virtually unmatched when it comes to fisticuffs. He's also able to use the environment to his advantage, turning everyday tools and appliances into deadly weapons. So far, he's been able to overcome every human opponent he's come across, with only Jody being able to best him (though Jesse defeated him too, eventually). He was even able to overpower Cassidy who, as a vampire, has enhanced strength.</p>
<p><b>Expert marksman</b>: Jesse is highly proficient in the use of various firearms. He has shown to be particularly skilled in sharpshooting.</p>
<p><b>Occult knowledge</b>: After meeting the angels, Jesse gained knowledge and insight of supernatural concepts, such as Heaven and Hell. </p>

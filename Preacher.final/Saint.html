<h1>Saint Of Killers</h1>
<p>The "Saint of Killers" is the title of a man named William. During the civil war, he earned the nickname, the Butcher of Gettysburg. The man had died and was damned to Hell. There, he was forced to relive his family's death over and over. Each time, he slaughtered everyone in Ratwater as vengeance for eternity. The man eventually had a visit from DeBlanc and Fiore, where they offered to release him from Hell if he killed Jesse Custer.</p>
<p>Released from Hell, the Saint is hellbent on killing Jesse. Eventually, the Saint of Killers was given an extract of Jesse's soul, making him vulnerable to Genesis. He was then locked in an armored truck beneath the Angelville swamps. He was later used by the Grail, only to be turned over to Mannering.</p>
<p>William served in the Confederate Army in the 4th Virginia Infantry. During the Battle of Gettysburg, he killed 77 men and several horses, earning himself the nickname "The Butcher of Gettysburg.</p>
<p>After the war, William fell in love with a woman and finally found peace in his life. The two raised a daughter. However, disease struck his family and his soul shattered the moment he discovered they had passed.</p>

<h2>Powers</h2>
<p><b>Immortality/invulnerability</b>: The Saint is immune to all forms of damage and, therefore, cannot be killed. He was unfazed when slammed into a post by a truck and shot with hundreds of bullets, both of which left no visible scratch of the skirmish on his body.</p>
<p><b>Superhuman Strength</b>: The Saint possesses noticeable superhuman strength, enough to effortlessly lift humans off the ground and send them flying across rooms with one arm and even push trucks out of the way and flip over buses. He is also far stronger than vampires like Denis and Cassidy, allowing him to overpower them with ease. As such, he was able to snap the former's neck without struggle while sneaking through Jesse's apartment and toss the latter through a wall, knocking him out. There does seem to be a limit to his strength, however, as he was unable to break out of the Souls Happy Go Go truck (though he was apparently weakened by Jesse's soul extract) and was unable to lift the tank that ran him over.</p>
<p><b>Hell's breath</b>: When trapped under a tank, the Saint was able to heat a Nazi's knife up to extremely high temperatures using his breath. He then used the said knife to blow up the tank. </p>
<h2>Former Powers</h2>
<p><b>Genesis immunity</b>: the Saint was able to resist Jesse's power when he had no soul.However, after receiving an extract of Jesse's soul, the Saint is no longer immune to Genesis.He presumably regained this power after the extract was drained from him.</p>
<p><b>Genesis tracker</b>: Every time Jesse uses the Word of God,the Saint can track down where Jesse has been. Especially confronting those who Jesse used the Word on.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p><b>Omnideadly guns</b>: The Saint of Killers' guns, a pair of Colt 1847 Walkers, are able to kill any individual, despite the individual's circumstance and powers. This was demonstrated when he shot both DeBlanc and Susan, both of whom are angels that do not reappear when shot. Additionally, he is the only one who can use these guns, as Tulip was unable to fire or unload the bullets.The guns are also immensely powerful, with a bullet able to penetrate a dozen walls before stopping. </p>
<p><b>Sword</b>: The Saint of Killers' sword is an old Confederate Army sword. It is unknown if it is able to kill any individual despite the individual's circumstance and powers like the Saint's guns as it has not been demonstrated on the show. He has used it to perform decapitations on the show.</p>
<p><b>Knife</b>: The Saint of Killers is equipped with a hunting knife. </p>
<h2>Legend of the Saint</h2>
<p>The Saint is very notorious. Many had heard legends and ghost stories of him. The Saint has also been featured as the logo of Ratwater Whiskey, named after the town he slaughtered. Many myths believe he is feared by Satan himself. </p>

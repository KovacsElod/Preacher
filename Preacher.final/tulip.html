<h1>Tulip O'Hare</h1>
<p>Priscilla-Jean Henrietta O'Hare, simply known as Tulip, is the fianc√© of Jesse Custer. Tulip often does dangerous jobs, getting herself into trouble. When she learned Jesse was back in town, Tulip asked Jesse for one last job with him. After Jesse finally agreed to kill Carlos, Tulip stopped him from doing so, as Tulip only needed to know how far Jesse would go for her. </p>
<p>When she learned God abandoned Heaven, Tulip embarked on a crusade with Jesse and Cassidy to find God. Along the way, she befriended "Jenny", who was actually Lara Featherstone, a Grail operative. After Jesse's mission alienated her and Jesse, Tulip was leaving for Bimini with Cassidy. As she was saying her goodbye to Jenny, she learned Jenny was a spy and was fatally shot.

She was soon after resurrected by Jesse's grandmother, Marie L'Angelle. </p>
<p>After her father returned from prison, she supported him in getting a job. When he got the job, she was overjoyed and was told he was going to get candy to celebrate. However, her mother wasn't too pleased and told her that her father was still worthless, prompting Tulip to shoot her mother through the door. Later, when her father returned, he had forgotten to get the candy after being caught up in an altercation with a co-worker. After her father was killed in a shootout, she was taken in by child protective services</p>

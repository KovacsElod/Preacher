<h1>Adolf Hitler</h1>
<p>Adolf Hitler is a former dictator and ruler of Nazi Germany. After his suicide, he was damned to Hell. However, after Eugene Root's arrival in Hell, Hitler was able to escape Hell while seemingly having a changed attitude. However, after escaping Hell, he ran off and began working as a sandwich artist as David Hilter, while secretly planning out a 4 year plan to return to power. </p>
<p>While on a date, his love interest insisted he show his art to an art gallery owner. Once Hitler did, his art was rejected. Soon after, communists invaded the cafe. Hitler then had an opportunity to kill them but chickened out at the last moment. His girlfriend then revealed she had been cheating on him. He then learned the last plum cake had been given to the Jewish man that had bumped into him earlier, despite Hitler ordering the cake first. At that moment, Hitler lost the goodness inside him and eventually began World War II.</p>
<p>When Hitler first arrived in Hell, he was appointed custodian. During his time as a Hell custodian, he had the opportunity to freely roam Hell and saw many "things" in the process.</p>

<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p><b>Great charisma</b>: As a former dictator, Hitler is a very charismatic speaker, quickly able to get a crowd to do what he wants. This is shown even further when he returns to Earth, as he is able to gain a following in a very short amount of time. </p>

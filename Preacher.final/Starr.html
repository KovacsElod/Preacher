<h1>Herr Starr</h1>
<p>Herr Klaus Helmut Starr is the leader of the Samson Unit under the Grail. After discovering Jesse Custer's power, Starr decided to throw a coup against the Grail, using Jesse as the new messiah instead of Humperdoo. However, after Custer's frequent betrayals and releasing Humperdoo into the world, Starr reached his breaking point and moved on, planning to torture and kill Jesse.</p>
<p>Klaus Starr was orphaned when he was four years old.</p>
<p>In 2004, as a Lieutenant Colonel of Germany's Anti-Terrorist unit GSG-9, Starr was invited to try out for the Grail. He succeeded all of the trials. His methods were highly unorthodox, including distracting one of his opponents by masturbating, threatening a woman he was supposed to seduce, tolerating his genitals being electrocuted, and finally killing the remaining candidate but not being disqualified for it.</p>
<p>Saltonstall explained to Starr the Grail's true goal: Maintain the bloodline of Christ. After being presented his new uniform, Klaus pushed Saltonstall off the tower and assumed command of the Samson Unit.</p>
